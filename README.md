# MRI Brain Scan Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of MRI brain scans into one of four categories [Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Normal (healthy brain), Pituitary Tumor]. As part of a group effort, each team member is developing individual models to tackle this classification problem. The project leverages an internal Kaggle competition to compare the performance of these models objectively.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises MRI brain scans, presented in a variety of angles and perspectives. Each scan falls into one of four distinct categories, making this a multi-class classification problem. The scans vary in terms of the visible brain regions and include both top-down and profile views. Each image is 256x256. There are 901 instances of class Glioma Tumor, 913 instances of class Meningioma Tumor, 438 instances of class Normal, and 844 instances of class Pituitary Tumor.

## Dataset Preparation

The dataset consists of MRI brain scans, each classified into one of four distinct categories. The preparation of this dataset involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Reserve Anonymous Kaggle Test Set

- 20% of the total images (3,096) are reserved for the Kaggle competition.
- This results in 619 images set aside for unbiased testing.

### Step 2: Dataset Split for Model Development

- The remaining 80% of the images are available for training and validation purposes.
- Each team member may choose their method of further splitting this subset for their model development.
