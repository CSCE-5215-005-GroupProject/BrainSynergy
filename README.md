# BrainSynergy: A Collaborative Kaggle Quest for Brain Tumor Identification

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of MRI brain scans into one of four categories [Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Normal (healthy brain), Pituitary Tumor]. As part of a group effort, each team member is developing individual models to tackle this classification problem. The project leverages an internal Kaggle competition to compare the performance of these models objectively.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises MRI brain scans, presented in a variety of angles and perspectives. Each scan falls into one of four distinct categories, making this a multi-class classification problem. The scans vary in terms of the visible brain regions and include both top-down and profile views. Each image is 256x256. There are 901 instances of class Glioma Tumor, 913 instances of class Meningioma Tumor, 438 instances of class Normal, and 844 instances of class Pituitary Tumor. The link to the dataset can be found on Kaggle here:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomasdubail/brain-tumors-256x256

## Dataset Preparation

The dataset consists of MRI brain scans, each classified into one of four distinct categories. The preparation of this dataset involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Reserve Anonymous Kaggle Test Set (data/kaggle_solutionSet)

- 20% of the total images (3,096) are reserved for the Kaggle competition.
- This results in 619 images set aside for unbiased testing.

### Step 2: Dataset Split for Model Development (data/competition_data)

- The remaining 80% of the images are available for training and validation purposes.
- Each team member may choose their method of further splitting this subset for their model development.

These steps occur in the datasetPrep.ipynb file within the data folder. 

## Team Members' Models

Below are the team members involved in this project, each with a subsection dedicated to their specific model and data plan.

### Joseph Caldwell (josephcaldwell@my.unt.edu)

As a part of the BrainSynergy Project, my primary focus has been on developing an innovative approach that combines a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a repurposed discriminator and an ensemble of classifiers. 

The GAN's discriminator, originally trained to distinguish between real and generated MRI brain scans, is adapted as a powerful feature extractor.

The extracted features are then fed into two distinct classifiers: a Random Forest and a simple Neural Network. 

These classifiers, each bringing their unique strengths to the table, predict the presence and type of brain tumors in the scans. 

To optimize performance, the predictions from both classifiers are ensembled through a majority voting system, ensuring a robust and accurate diagnosis. This model not only leverages the generative power of GANs but also harnesses traditional machine learning and neural network techniques, creating a hybrid solution tailored for medical image analysis.

### GAN Architecture Summary

#### Generator

The generator in this GAN is designed to upscale a noise input into a 256x256 grayscale image. Its architecture is as follows:

- **Initial Dense Layer**: This dense layer takes a noise vector of dimension `noise_dim` and transforms it into an 8x8x1024 tensor. This layer does not use bias and is followed by batch normalization and a LeakyReLU activation function.
- **Reshape**: The output from the dense layer is reshaped into a 3D tensor of shape 8x8x1024.
- **Deconvolutional Layers**: These layers progressively upscale the image's resolution while reducing its depth:
  - First layer upscales to 16x16 with 512 filters.
  - Second layer upscales to 32x32 with 256 filters.
  - Third layer upscales to 64x64 with 128 filters.
  - Fourth layer upscales to 128x128 with 64 filters.
- **Final Layer**: The final deconvolutional layer upscales to the target size of 256x256 with a single filter for grayscale output. It uses a 'tanh' activation function.
- Each deconvolutional layer uses a 5x5 kernel, a stride of 2x2, batch normalization (except the last layer), and LeakyReLU activation (except the last layer).

#### Discriminator

The discriminator's role is to classify images as real or generated. Its architecture is:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts 256x256x1 grayscale images (for RGB images, this would be 256x256x3).
- **Convolutional Layers**: These layers progressively downsample the image:
  - First layer downsamples to 128x128 with 64 filters, followed by dropout to prevent overfitting.
  - Second layer downsamples to 64x64 with 128 filters, followed by dropout to prevent overfitting.
  - Third layer downsamples to 32x32 with 256 filters, followed by batch normalization for more stable outputs. It is these outputs that will be used as features for the classification model.
  - Fourth layer downsamples to 16x16 with 512 filters, followed by dropout to prevent overfitting.
- **Flatten and Dense Layer**: The final output is flattened and passed through a dense layer with a single unit for binary classification.
- Each convolutional layer uses a 5x5 kernel, a stride of 2x2.

#### GAN Summary

This GAN architecture is tailored for processing MRI brain scans, with the generator creating realistic images from random noise and the discriminator distinguishing between real and generated images. The use of batch normalization and LeakyReLU activation functions contributes to the model's stability and efficiency during training.

## Model Overview:
The model leverages the EfficientNetB0 architecture, which is acclaimed for balancing model complexity with accuracy. Using ImageNet's extensive dataset, it's a solid foundation, able to recognize a broad range of features.  
 
 By employing transfer learning, the pre-trained model was fine-tuned to specialize in the identification of brain tumor images. We're using this approach to apply ImageNet's learning to our specific medical imaging task.  
 
The model was adapted to our unique dataset, comprising various brain tumor MRI images. The adaptability of EfficientNetB0 enables it to learn from our specific data, thereby enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. 
 
Objective: the project's objective is to harness the model's advanced feature recognition to improve the accuracy of diagnosing brain tumors,and  employ this model to detect and classify brain tumors.


## Model Architecture & Design:

- Foundation: Utilized the EfficientNetB0 architecture, which was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This model is celebrated for its compound scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution. 

- Customization: Input shape tailored to (224x224x3) to match our dataset, allowing the model to process our MRI images effectively. This size was chosen as a balance between detail retention and computational efficiency. 

- Data Augmentation: To prevent the model from overfitting and improves its ability to generalize to new, unseen data, I implemented an augmentation strategy with: 
Random horizontal and vertical flips. 
Random rotations of up to 20% of 360 degrees. 
Random zooming up to 20%. 
Random brightness changes, enhancing contrast by up to 20%. These augmentations were integrated using TensorFlow's Keras preprocessing layers. 

- Pooling and Classification Layers: After the base EfficientNetB0 layers, I used GlobalAveragePooling2D to compress the feature maps, reducing the model's complexity and computational load. The final layer is a dense layer with softmax activation, classifying into four categories: glioma, meningioma, notumor, and pituitary tumors. 

## Model Training & Validation:

- Dataset Management: Our dataset, comprising high-resolution brain MRI images, was systematically divided, reserving 80% for training and 20% for validation. This distribution was meticulously chosen to ensure a robust training set while retaining a representative validation set for accurate model performance assessment. 

- Training Strategy: The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer, Setting the Model to be Trainable: Initially, the base model, EfficientNetB0, was set to be not trainable (base_model.trainable = False) during the first phase of training. This was done to freeze the weights of the pre-trained network, so only the new layers I added (like the Dense output layer) would be trained.The model was trained over 100 epochs .

- Hyperparameters and Validation:I used a batch size of 32 to balance between computational efficiency and model performance.The validation split was set at 20% to ensure a sufficient amount of data for model evaluation while maximizing the data available for training. 

- Performance Metrics: befor Fine_ Tunning my model achieved an accuracy of : 0.85% on the training set and 0.77% on the validation set . 

### Fine-tuning in my project was implemented as follows:

- Enabling Fine-Tuning: After the initial training, the base model was set to be trainable (base_model.trainable = True). This step allows the weights in the pre-trained layers to be updated during training. 

- Selective Layer Training: I decided to fine-tune from a certain layer onwards (fine_tune_at = 100). This means that the layers before the 100th layer in the EfficientNetB0 model were kept frozen (layer.trainable = False for layers in base_model.layers[:fine_tune_at]), and the layers from the 100th onwards were set to be trainable. (which capture more specific features). 

- Hyperparameter Optimization and Re-compiling the Model: the learning rate, initially set to 1e-4, and the batch size of 32 were iteratively fine-tuned. This is important in fine-tuning because a lower learning rate ensures that the model does not deviate too much from the learned weights. 

- Continued Training: Finally, the model was trained for additional epochs (FINE_TUNE_EPOCHS = 60, 40). This continued training allowed the trainable layers of the base model to adjust their weights (fine-tune) to better fit the specific data of your project. 

## Performance Metrics: 
- befor Fine_ Tuning my model achieved an accuracy of : 0.85% on the training set and 0.77% on the validation set . 

- After Fine_ Tuning my model achieved an accuracy of : 0.97% on the training set and 0.91% on the validation set.
